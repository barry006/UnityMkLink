# UnityMkLink


Symbolic Link Creator Script for Unity Editor (Windows Only).

This Unity Editor script allows you to create symbolic links directly from within the Unity Editor, compatible only with Windows. By selecting a source folder (the actual location) and a destination folder (the location where the symbolic link will be created), the script generates a symbolic link using the mklink command. It provides an easy way to manage file system links without needing to use the command line.
